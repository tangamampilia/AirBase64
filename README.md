Base64Encoder
=============

ANE for Base64 Support (iOS &amp; Air Simulator)

I created this ANE because decoding and encoding ByteArray or BitmapData to Base64 is ver expensive. Works on iOS, Air Simulator and Android.


Installation
---------

The ANE binary (Base64Encoder.ane) is located in the *bin* folder. You should add it to your application project's Build Path and make sure to package it with your app (more information [here](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS597e5dadb9cc1e0253f7d2fc1311b491071-8000.html)).


Build script
---------

If you need to edit the extension source code and/or recompile it, you will find an ant build script (build.xml) in the *build* folder. I also added a shell.sh script to make it easy. You just need to edit the Flash Builder path:
