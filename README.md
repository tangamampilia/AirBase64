Base64Encoder
=============

ANE for Base64 Support (iOS &amp; Air Simulator)

I created this ANE because decoding and encoding ByteArray or BitmapData to Base64 is very slow. It should work on iOS and Air Simulator. I'm working on Android and Blackberry version.


Installation
---------

The ANE binary (Base64Encoder.ane) is located in the *bin* folder. You should add it to your application project's Build Path and make sure to package it with your app (more information [here](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS597e5dadb9cc1e0253f7d2fc1311b491071-8000.html)).


Build script
---------

If you need to edit the extension source code and/or recompile it, you will find an ant build script (build.xml) in the *build* folder. I also added a shell.sh script to make it easy. You just need to edit the Flash Builder path:
